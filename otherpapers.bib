abstract="In this paper we describe the Pegasus system that can map complex workflows onto the Grid. Pegasus takes an abstract description of a workflow and finds the appropriate data and Grid resources to execute the workflow. Pegasus is being released as part of the GriPhyN Virtual Data Toolkit and has been used in a variety of applications ranging from astronomy, biology, gravitational-wave science, and high-energy physics. A deferred planning mode of Pegasus is also introduced.",

These pipelines can be executed on local desktop machines or through larger infrastructure (such as supercomputers, Grids or cloud environments), using the Taverna Server. In bioinformatics, Taverna workflows are typically used in the areas of high-throughput omics analyses (for example, proteomics or transcriptomics), or for evidence gathering methods involving text mining or data mining. Through Taverna, scientists have access to several thousand different tools and resources that are freely available from a large range of life science institutions. Once constructed, the workflows are reusable, executable bioinformatics protocols that can be shared, reused and repurposed. A repository of public workflows is available at http://www.myexperiment.org. This article provides an update to the Taverna tool suite, highlighting new features and developments in the workbench and the Taverna Server.},

In particular, Pegasus can be configured to generate an executable workflow based on application-specific attributes. In that configuration, Pegasus uses and AI-based planner to perform the mapping from high-level metadata descriptions to a workflow that can be executed on the Grid. This configuration of Pegasus was used in the context of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) pulsar search. We conducted a successful demonstration of the system at SC 2002 during which time we ran approximately 200 pulsar searches.",
